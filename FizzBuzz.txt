I usually see this as in interview question, not a kata, but it is apparently
still used as one.  What makes it interesting, however, is the possibility of
writing this in a great many languages, and the kata consists of implementing
it in multiple in one sitting,  switching between languages on the fly.

(An interesting variation would be to choose three or four languages and
implement the features (fizz on %3, buzz on %5, fizzbuzz on both) in each
language before moving on.)
