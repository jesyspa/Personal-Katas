This is a repository for Code Katas that I wish to practice.  It consists of
several branches, each branch being one kata.

It is generally advised to write tests for code written for katas before the
actual implementation;  to allow for this to be easier, I've written some basic
files that are necessary every time the kata is done (Makefile, test launcher,
etc.)

It also seems common to do kata exercises in the order listed, without
immediately implementing later features.

Several instructions for more kata are available on the web:
 - http://codekata.pragprog.com/
 - http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue
 - http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata
 - http://codingkata.net/
 - http://invalidcast.com/2011/09/the-ordered-jobs-kata

The instructions for these kata are not listed, but a link to them and some
files to get started (as well as any solutions I wish to keep) are.
