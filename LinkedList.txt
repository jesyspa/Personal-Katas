In this kata, you are to write a linked list.  Don't be discouraged if your
language does not provide pointers -- it's just as fun to do with references
(although you may be in trouble if your language lacks those, too).

Assignments:
 1. Make a function that can store one number in the list (hard to test).
 2. Make a function that returns the last number added.
 3. Make a function that can remove the last stored number.
 4. Change the function made in 2 to return the last number added that has not
    been removed.
 5. Make the function that adds a number to the list be able to add multiple
    numbers, all of which can be removed with the function made in 3.
 6. Make a function that returns a string representation of the list, or that
    prints the list to a stream.
 7. Make a function that adds a number to the other side of the list.
 8. Make a function that removes the number from the other side of the list.
 9. Make it possible to traverse the list with an iterator (exact name for this
    functionality depends on the language).
