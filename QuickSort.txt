Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that should make an average of O(nlog n)
comparisons to sort n items, with a worst case of O(n^2) comparisons.

Quicksort operates by selecting a pivot value, then reordering the array so
that all elements less than the pivot are before it, and all elements greater
than it are after it.  After this, the pivot need not be moved again.

The algorithm is then applied to both sides of the pivot, once again choosing a
pivot value and reordering.  This is applied recursively until all elements are
in place.
